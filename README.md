## Process
After completing the Rock Paper Scissors project, I went ahead and started the next project, which was to implement a Etch-a-sketch/Sketchpad webpage.

This involved using mostly the same DOM methods as before except this time, due to the large amount of elements created, I got to use the ```document.querySelectorAll()``` function.

## Struggle
I had to spend some time figuring out how to get the ratio of squares to size of the grid to make everything match up together.

In the end, left it as is to publish, but I will return to this program to implement more features.

## Next Steps
- Implement size adjustment.
- Add color options.
- Don't know what else...
